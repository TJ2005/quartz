# Introduction
We generated a substantial amount of data, organized it systematically, and then utilized a [[DBMS]] for efficient management. This project explores various aspects of DBMS.

# Content

## Pinging
Pinging is literally sending requests to the network to the address you write after the command.

#### Syntax
The command for windows is given by
`ping address`

#### Storing Outputs
Store this ping output by this 
`ping <address> > output.txt`

#### Example
For pinging nmims.in at college we got this output 
```powershell
Pinging nmims.in [95.217.93.209] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 95.217.93.209: bytes=32 time=140ms TTL=49
Reply from 95.217.93.209: bytes=32 time=139ms TTL=49
Reply from 95.217.93.209: bytes=32 time=263ms TTL=49
Reply from 95.217.93.209: bytes=32 time=229ms TTL=49

Ping statistics for 95.217.93.209:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 139ms, Maximum = 263ms, Average = 192ms
```



#### Using Ping to estimate distance
This is the most horrible way to estimate actual distance... Regardless

Here we got the delay to be 140ms for one packet to calculate the distance we will account for The Speed in copper wire is $2*10^8$

To calculate the distance on an average basis (not accurate) we can apply

$$velocity = distance/time$$
$$2*10^8 = distance/140*10^-3$$
therefore
$$distance = 2*10^8*140*10^-3$$

Distance = 28000000m
Distance = 280000km
The distance it covered is probably 280,000 kms

To retrieve locations one shall check [[IP Lookup]]

## [[Netstat]]


The `netstat` command is a network utility tool available in various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It provides detailed information about network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships. Here are some common usages and options:

- **Proto:** Protocol being used (e.g., [[TCP]], [[UDP]]).
- **Recv-Q:** The count of bytes not copied by the user program connected to this socket.
- **Send-Q:** The count of bytes not acknowledged by the remote host.
- **Local Address:** The address and port number of the local end of the connection.
- **Foreign Address:** The address and port number of the remote end of the connection.
- **State:** The state of the connection (e.g., LISTEN, ESTABLISHED).

##### Example 
- **Protocol:** [[TCP]]
- **Recv-Q:** 0 (no bytes waiting to be read)
- **Send-Q:** 0 (no bytes waiting to be acknowledged)
- **Local Address:** localhost (local machine) on port `domain` (53, typically used for DNS)
- **Foreign Address:** `*:*` (listening for any incoming connection)
- **State:** LISTEN (the socket is waiting for a connection)
```shell
tcp        0      0 localhost:domain        *:*                     LISTEN
```

- **Protocol:** [[TCP]]

- **Send-Q:** 0 (no bytes waiting to be acknowledged)
 - **Local Address:** 192.168.1.5 (local machine) on port `ssh` (22)
 - **Foreign Address:** 192.168.1.10 on port 59382 (the remote machine connected to this SSH session)
- **State:** ESTABLISHED (the connection is active)
```shell
tcp        0      0 192.168.1.5:ssh         192.168.1.10:59382      ESTABLISHED

```

- **Protocol:** UDP
- **Recv-Q:** 0 (no bytes waiting to be read)
- **Send-Q:** 0 (no bytes waiting to be acknowledged)
- **Local Address:** 192.168.1.5 on port `ntp` (123, used for Network Time Protocol)
- **Foreign Address:** `*:*` (listening for any incoming packet)

```shell
udp        0      0 192.168.1.5:ntp         *:*                     
```
### Common Usage

1. **Displaying All Connections:**
   ```sh
   netstat -a
   ```
   This option displays all active connections and listening ports.

2. **Displaying Listening Ports:**
   ```sh
   netstat -l
   ```
   This option shows only the listening [[ports|port]].

3. **Displaying Network Statistics:**
   ```sh
   netstat -s
   ```
   This option displays network statistics for each protocol.

4. **Displaying Routing Table:**
   ```sh
   netstat -r
   ```
   This option shows the routing table.

5. **Displaying Interface Statistics:**
   ```sh
   netstat -i
   ```
   This option provides statistics for network interfaces.

6. **Displaying PID and Program Names (Linux only):**
   ```sh
   netstat -p
   ```
   This option shows the PID and program names for each connection.

### Combining Options

You can combine options to get more specific information. For example:

- Display all listening [[TCP]] ports and their corresponding process IDs:
  ```sh
  netstat -ltp
  ```

- Display all active connections with numeric addresses:
  ```sh
  netstat -an
  ```

### Windows Specific Options

In Windows, `netstat` has some additional options:

- **Displaying the Executable Involved in Creating Each Connection or Listening Port:**
  ```sh
  netstat -b
  ```

- **Displaying Ethernet Statistics:**
  ```sh
  netstat -e
  ```

- **Refreshing Every Interval of Seconds:**
  ```sh
  netstat -e [interval]
  ```

### Examples

- To display all active [[TCP]] connections:
  ```sh
  netstat -at
  ```

- To display all active [[UDP]] connections:
  ```sh
  netstat -au
  ```

- To display detailed information about the connections, including the address, port, and state:
  ```sh
  netstat -an
  ```

`netstat` is a powerful tool for network diagnostics and troubleshooting, helping administrators understand and manage network connections and activity on their systems.


## Summary

`netstat -a ` in most operating systems shows networking information that is available about network connections. They are mostly:
- **Proto:** Protocol being used (e.g., TCP, UDP).
- **Recv-Q:** Bytes not yet copied by the user program. ( Received Byte Count from the program using that port )
- **Send-Q:** Bytes not yet acknowledged by the remote host. ( Bytes that the other receiving end didn't count / use from the sent packets from that specific port)
- **Local Address:** Local address and port number. ( Local Address of the port )
- **Foreign Address:** Remote address and port number. ( Foreign address if any )
- **State:** Connection state (e.g., LISTEN, ESTABLISHED). ( [[Half Duplex]] / [[Half Duplex]])

## [[TraceRT]]
### Definition
The `tracert` command (short for "trace route") is a network diagnostic tool used to track the pathway that a packet of data takes from your computer to a destination host, such as a website or server. It is available on Windows, while the equivalent command on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) is `traceroute`.

### Purpose and Usage
The primary purpose of `tracert` is to identify the route and measure the transit delays of packets across an IP network. It is helpful for diagnosing network connectivity issues and pinpointing where packets are being delayed or lost.

### How It Works

1. **Sending Packets with Incrementing TTL:**
   `tracert` works by sending a series of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request packets to the destination with varying Time-To-Live (TTL) values. The TTL value starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each subsequent packet.

2. **ICMP Time Exceeded Messages:**
   Each router that handles a packet decrements the TTL by 1. When the TTL reaches 0, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source. This way, `tracert` can identify each hop along the path to the destination.

3. **Final Destination:**
   When the packet finally reaches the destination, it sends an ICMP Echo Reply message, indicating that the destination has been reached.

### Common Usage and Options

#### Basic Syntax

```sh
tracert [hostname or IP address]
```

#### Example

To trace the route to example.com:

```sh
tracert example.com
```
