# Methods to check consistency

Certainly! Let’s delve into the methods for testing the consistency of a system of linear equations. I’ll break down the steps for both homogeneous and non-homogeneous systems.

### Method 1: Square Matrix (Applicable for n unknowns and n equations)

1. **Square Matrix A**: If you have a system of n equations with n unknowns, the matrix of coefficients (A) must be square. In other words, the number of equations should match the number of unknowns.
    
    Consider the system:
    
    $$AX = B \\ AX=B$$ 

    
    - If A is a square matrix, you can proceed with the following steps.
    - Multiply both sides by the inverse of A:
        
        $A^{-1}AX = A^{-1}BA−1AX=A−1B$
        
        This simplifies to:
        
        $X = A^{-1}BX=A−1B$
        

### Method 2 : Non-Homogeneous Linear Equations:

1. **Matrix Form**: Write down the given system in matrix form:
    
    $$AX = BAX=B$$
    
2. **Row Echelon Form**: Reduce matrix A to row echelon form.
3. **Rank Comparison**:
    - Determine the rank of matrix A.
    - Calculate the rank of the augmented matrix $([A | B]).$ 
4. **Consistency Check**:
    - If $Rank(A) < Rank(([A | B]))$, the system is inconsistent (no solution).
    - If $Rank(A) = Rank(([A | B]))$:
        - If the rank equals the number of unknowns, there is a unique solution.
        - Otherwise, there are infinitely many solutions.

### Method 3: Homogeneous System:

1. **Matrix Form**: Write down the given system in matrix form:
    
    $AX = 0AX=0$
    
2. **Row Echelon Form**: Reduce matrix A to row echelon form.
3. **Rank Comparison**:
    - Compare the rank of matrix A with the number of unknowns.
4. **Solution Types**:
    - If $Rank(A) =$number of unknowns, the only solution is the trivial solution (zero solution).
    - If $Rank(A) <$ number of unknowns, there are non-trivial solutions (parameters take arbitrary values).
