kw# Djikstra's Algorithm
![[IMG-20241212131500757.png]]
This image shows a detailed illustration of **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, which is used to find the shortest paths from a starting node (node A in this case) to all other nodes in a graph. It is often used in routing and link-state protocols, such as **Link-State Routing**.

Let me walk you through the elements in this diagram and explain how Dijkstra's Algorithm works step by step.

### **1. The Graph**

The graph shown in the diagram consists of six nodes: **A, B, C, D, E, F**. The edges between these nodes have weights, which represent the cost or distance between two directly connected nodes.

Here's a summary of the graph's edges:
- **A → B**: Cost is 3
- **A → C**: Cost is 2
- **B → D**: Cost is 4
- **C → D**: Cost is 1
- **C → F**: Cost is 4
- **D → E**: Cost is 3
- **E → F**: Cost is 2

### **2. The Table Structure**

The table in the diagram shows the process of Dijkstra's Algorithm iteration by iteration. Here's what each part of the table represents:

- **Iteration**: Shows the steps of the algorithm. The algorithm adds one node to the shortest path tree in each iteration.
- **Tree**: Represents the set of nodes that have been added to the shortest path tree at that step.
- The columns **B, C, D, E, F**: Show the current shortest known distance from the starting node (A) to each of these nodes at the particular step.
- The values in parentheses indicate the current distance to a node. If the distance is infinity (∞), it means that the node has not been reached yet.

### **Dijkstra's Algorithm - Step by Step**

Let's break down the iterations shown in the diagram.

#### **Initial Step:**
- **Tree**: `{A}` (starting node is A).
- **B, C, D, E, F**: Initial distances from A to other nodes:
  - A → B = 3 (direct edge)
  - A → C = 2 (direct edge)
  - A → D, E, F = ∞ (no direct path known yet)
- So, initially, the shortest known path from A is:
  - **A → B = 3**
  - **A → C = 2**
  - **A → D, E, F = ∞**

  The algorithm chooses the node with the smallest distance that hasn't been added to the tree yet, which is **C** (cost = 2).

#### **Iteration 1**:
- **Tree**: `{A, C}` (C is added since it's the closest).
- Now, update the distances to the other nodes based on node C:
  - From **C → D**, the cost is 2 + 1 = 3 (A → C → D).
  - From **C → F**, the cost is 2 + 4 = 6 (A → C → F).
  - The distance to B remains unchanged at 3.
  - So now, the shortest known path distances are:
    - A → B = 3
    - A → C = 2
    - A → D = 3
    - A → F = 6
    - A → E = ∞
  - **B** and **D** both have a distance of 3, so the algorithm can choose either. In this case, **B** is chosen.

#### **Iteration 2**:
- **Tree**: `{A, B, C}` (B is added).
- The distances are updated based on node B:
  - From **B → D**, the cost is 3 + 4 = 7, but the existing distance to D through C is shorter (A → C → D = 3), so no update is made.
  - The other distances remain the same:
    - A → B = 3
    - A → C = 2
    - A → D = 3
    - A → F = 6
    - A → E = ∞
  - The algorithm now chooses **D** because it has the smallest distance (3).

#### **Iteration 3**:
- **Tree**: `{A, B, C, D}` (D is added).
- The distances are updated based on node D:
  - From **D → E**, the cost is 3 + 3 = 6 (A → C → D → E).
  - The distance to F stays 6.
  - So now, the shortest known path distances are:
    - A → B = 3
    - A → C = 2
    - A → D = 3
    - A → E = 6
    - A → F = 6
  - Now the algorithm can choose either **E** or **F** (both have a distance of 6), so **F** is chosen in this iteration.

#### **Iteration 4**:
- **Tree**: `{A, B, C, D, F}` (F is added).
- Since all remaining nodes already have updated distances, no changes occur in the table:
  - A → B = 3
  - A → C = 2
  - A → D = 3
  - A → E = 6
  - A → F = 6
  - The only remaining node is **E**, which is added in the next iteration.

#### **Iteration 5**:
- **Tree**: `{A, B, C, D, E, F}` (all nodes are added to the tree).
- The algorithm completes since all nodes have been processed and the shortest paths are found.

### **Final Shortest Path Tree**:

After all iterations, the shortest paths from **A** to all other nodes are as follows:
- A → C = 2
- A → B = 3
- A → D = 3 (via C)
- A → E = 6 (via D)
- A → F = 6 (via C)

---

### **Summary of the Steps**:
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** works by iteratively adding the closest (minimum distance) node to the shortest path tree and updating the distances to its neighboring nodes.
- The algorithm guarantees that, once a node is added to the tree, the shortest path to that node is found.
- The table helps to track the current shortest distance from the source node **A** to each other node at each step of the algorithm.
